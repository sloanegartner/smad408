    <h1>Independent Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>The AleHouse: Redesign</h2>
      <p>The AleHouse was my redesign project from SMAD 307. The project was to redesign an already existing site. I decided to combine the Harrisonburgs websites, that provided information on the Breweries and Wineries in the area, to create a one stop shop for users to find what they're looking for. The site contains the most popular Breweries and Wineries in the area, as well as a list of beers that are commonly sold in resturants.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>I've decided to fix this project because I like the idea of the site and I believe I can make it better. This project was to help learn and practice with Bootstrap, and I feel that I can do a better job now that I know more about the features of Bootstrap. The work contains an "About" page, which features information on the visitors center in Downtown Harrisonburg. I added this page for in case the website didn't provide enough information, at least it can provide information on how to learn more. There is then the "Breweries" and "Wineries" page, which contain the top five most popular Breweries and Wineries in the area. There are then links to the Breweries and Wineries websites. I then have a "Drinks" page which contains a list of popular drinks sold in the area. This allows for the user to be able to do quick research on the type of drink they would like to have. The visuals I added were all my own, and I would like to work more on them as well as organize there placement.</p> 

    <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>My top goals are the Home page and organizing the site. When I started the site, I don't think I had a full idea before I started designing. I now have a better idea on information the site should and should not have. I would also like to fix the design of the Home page. I had trouble with the Home page starting out and would like to continue working and fixing it until I have it the way I want it. Another goal I have is a simple one. I would like to design a logo and then fix the visuals on the site. I feel like this will make the site look more professional and less like a school assignment. To relate to technically Wrong, I will think of my edge cases while organizing my content. I am making this site for visitors and students in the area, but I should also think about the locals and add Breweries and Wineries that aren't well known. I would assume that locals know all the common and popular drinks and places, so I should add a few names that are less popular or mainstream so that the locals can also benefit from the site and branch out. Overall my 3 main goals are shown below:</p>
        <li>Home Page Design</li>
        <li>Organize Content</li>
        <li>Add/Design Logo and Fix Visuals</li>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>My audience is the same from when I started the site. They would be college students who would like to explore Breweries and Wineries as well as individuals who would like to expand on their drink of choice. The site can also speak to people new in the area who want to know more about what Harrisonburg and Rockingham County have to offer. <br>
      My primary persona would be a young adult or student, who has an occasional drink with friends after work. She's tried to expand out from her usual drink of choice, but the last couple times she has, they haven't been her favorite. She doesn't want to take a chance and spend money on something she'll end up not liking. She also is tired of the same wine and has the goal to expand her pallet. The website would be able to serve as a better search engine for locals to use in the Harrisonburg community. This would allow for the local breweries and wineries to gain new customers as well as business since the site would appeal to their main audience.</p>

      <div class="middle">
       <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 1.3em;">This is my original website. I would like to fix the Home page, add a logo, fix the footer, organize content, and add/adjust the visuals. Overall, I would like this to look less like a school assignment and more like a professional portfolio piece. Below is a link to Restless Moon Breweries site. This is what I am trying to have my site look like.</p>

       <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 1.3em;">This is the logo I've been working on. I would like to maybe change the color and add to the design. My idea is to add this to the Home page. I would also like this to replace the words "The AleHouse" in the top left corner and have it instead be the logo.</p>
